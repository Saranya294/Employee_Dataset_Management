**üöÄPROJECT TITLE : Employee Management System (EMS)**
- The Employee Management System (EMS) is a database-driven project designed to efficiently manage employee-related information within an organization.It helps track employee personal details, job roles, salary structures, qualifications, leave records, and payroll data.
           
- The system ensures data accuracy and consistency using relational tables, foreign keys, and cascading actions.

- It also provides useful insights such as payroll calculation, leave tracking, and department-wise analysis to support HR operations.


**üìùPROBLEM STATEMENT** 

Managing employee data is often difficult when information is scattered across multiple files or systems.
This can cause:
        - Errors in payroll calculation
        - Difficulty in tracking leaves
        - Inefficiency in HR processes

Solution:

This project integrates all employee-related details into a single system.
By using relational database design with foreign keys and cascading updates/deletes, the system keeps data consistent and allows easy management of:
                    - Job departments
                    - Employee details
                    - Salary and bonuses
                    - Qualifications
                    - Leave records
                    - Payroll processing
